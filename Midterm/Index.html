                <p id= "Left">
                    JBL has been around for over 70 years and even put on woodstock in 1969. JBL stands for James Bullough Lansing, the founder of JBL in 1946. JBL started out making drivers for events and cars. Later they started to move to the personal market making bluetooth speakers. The first JBL bluetooth speaker was the Flip which is now on its 5th generation. Now, JBL is a household name through the bluetooth speakers.

                    What Does This Mean For JBL
                </h3>
                <p id= "Right">
                    Long story short, all this means is that most of JBL's revinue comes in through their bluetooth speaker sales. This also means that a lot of their development goes twords bluetooth speakers as well. They still work on their car and even speakers, they just are not thier focus anymore.
